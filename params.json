{"name":"Mini Class on Higgs Discovery","tagline":"Mini class at the NYU Physics Department for Spring 2014 about the Higgs Boson discovery.","body":"\r\n### Aims and scope\r\n\r\nHands-on with the Higgs Discovery. Understand the experimental effort and challenges on the theory side. Familiarize with techniques that are used to _claim a discovery_ and what it means to _measure_ the Higgs mass or couplings.\r\n\r\n__Audience__: For Freshmen and Juniors. Knowledge of Freshmen Physics, introductory Quantum Mechanics but no Quantum Field Theory or Particle Physics knowledge is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nSven Kreiss, <sk@svenkreiss.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Course Material\r\n\r\nSome material and links will appear under the link “View On GitHub” on the left.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Topics and Schedule\r\n\r\nClasses are scheduled for __Mondays at 2pm in the CCPP lounge__ (Meyer building, 5th floor).\r\n\r\n1. __February 3__: CERN, LHC, ATLAS, CMS, Geneva. Big Science. History: Thompson, Rutherford, fixed target, past colliders, discovery W/Z top tau.\r\n\r\n2. __February 10__: A theory of nature with symmetry. Fermions, Bosons, Leptons, Quarks and their quantum numbers in the SM. Noether’s theorem, particle masses, charge conservation. Detectors: tracker, EM calo, had calo, muon tracker. Data acquisition and triggers.\r\n\r\n3. __February 24__: Electroweak symmetry breaking. Mass for Gauge Bosons. Yukawa couplings for Fermion masses. Hadron collider, Protons, Parton Distribution Functions. Higgs production modes and decay channels.\r\n\r\n4. __March 3__: Monte-Carlo generation, detector simulation. Building a statistical model to test the Higgs hypothesis. Statistics: p-value, upper limit, signal strength. Understand LHC plots. Combination of Higgs searches. Discovery. Couplings. Spin/Parity.\r\n\r\n5. (March 10) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credits and Assessments\r\n\r\nThis is a zero credit course and there are no exams or written tests.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
