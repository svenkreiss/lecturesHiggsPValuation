{"name":"Mini Class on Higgs Discovery","tagline":"Mini class at the NYU Physics Department for Spring 2014 about the Higgs Boson discovery.","body":"## Aims and scope\r\n\r\nHands-on with the Higgs Discovery. Understand the experimental effort and challenges on the theory side. Familiarize with techniques that are used to _claim a discovery_ and what it means to _measure_ the Higgs mass or couplings.\r\n\r\n__Audience__: For Freshmen and Juniors. Knowledge of Freshmen Physics, introductory Quantum Mechanics but no Quantum Field Theory or Particle Physics knowledge is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nSven Kreiss, <sk@svenkreiss.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Course Material\r\n\r\nThere are no books required for this class. Some material and links will appear under the link _View On GitHub_ on the left.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Topics and Schedule\r\n\r\nClasses are scheduled for __Mondays at 2pm in the CCPP lounge__ (Meyer building, 5th floor).\r\n\r\n1. __February 3__: CERN, LHC, ATLAS, CMS, Geneva. Big Science.  \r\nIntroduction to Particle Physics.\r\n\r\n2. __February 10__: Theories of nature with symmetry. Fields and interactions. Particle detectors and data acquisition.  \r\n.  \r\n__No class on February 17__.\r\n\r\n3. __February 24__: Particle masses. The Higgs boson and electroweak symmetry breaking. Hadron colliders. Higgs production modes and decay channels.\r\n\r\n4. __March 3__: Simulating the LHC. Statistical modeling to test the Higgs hypothesis. Understand LHC results. Discovery. Properties.\r\n\r\n5. (March 10) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits and Assessments\r\n\r\nThis is a zero credit course and there are no exams or written tests.","google":"UA-47422401-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
